# Current Ideas
Here is a list of my ideas.

You can email me if you like any of the ideas and think that you could collaborate on them with me and help me build them.

## Recruitement Disruptor
My frustration with IT recruitement consultants and the recruitment industry in general inspires me to create something to disrupt the
industry and take recruitment agents out of the equation thus saving employee frustration with having to deal with recruiters and the
cost of engaging with them for the business that is recruiting

Needs development but it needs to include a way of vetting the people looking for a job and testing their skillsets and checking their identities. Plus getting the matching between business and employee well matched (something that often eludes recruitement agents)

## Wearables Price Spotter
A website that details wearable devices and the best prices available to purchase the device.

Helping people find the best prices for wearable technology

1. Website with search and details of prices
2. Users can become spotters and add a price or offer if they have come across one
3. Spotters could get badges or prizes for contributions to best prices spots

## Asset Compliance
A SAAS offering that allows business to detail assets that they maintain and schedule surveys to be carries out on them. Custom surveys could
be created and reported on with outcomes logged.

Potentiall use something like surveyjs to do the survey creation as json files

Dashboards would be able to report on wehether assets are in or out of compliance. PowerBI? Simple charting tools? chartjs?

I have templates for the design of this already to be used

## Fitness Workout Creator
I haven't found a decent intuative workout logger app out there yet.

Create worksouts that details the exercises and reps/sets, progess on body measuresments and weights lifted ect.

Technologies that I have in mind for these:
Ionic framework
Firebase backend

## Park Gym Finder
Park gyms are becoming popular these days and it would be good to utilise google maps to be able to find ones near you that also details the
equipment available (pull up bars, parallel bars ect)

Users could arrange meetups and find workout buddies.

Leave comments on the equipment?

This idea would be a good technical stack that could be repurposed to find other things too
